# SimonGame
Simple Simon Game. Build using JS-UI-Framework React (based on Create-React-App).

## Directions
- Use the settings to the left to decide whether you want to be "x" or "o" and wether "x" or "o" should start the game.
- Furthermore, you can choose whether you want to play against the Easy or Hard Computer Opponent. Be careful: You cannot win vs the Hard Computer! ;)
- After you are happy with your settings, press Start Game.
- Whenever it is your turn, choose an unoccupied space from the board.

Good luck! ;)
