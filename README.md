# SimonGame
Simple Simon Game. Build using JS-UI-Framework React (based on Create-React-App).

## Directions
Press the "startGame" Button to start a round.
Listen/Watch what the sequence is. Afterwards, repeat it.
The length of the sequence increments by 1 each time you repeat it correctly. 
The Game is won if you repeated a sequence of len 20 correctly.

## Settings
While playing, you can toggle the "Strict" mode.
Normally, you can just restart at the current count if you commit a mistake.
However, in "Strict" mode, you have to start over if you fail.
